React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

To get started with the React, go to  React official https://reactjs.org/ documentation website.


Apollo Client is a fully-featured caching GraphQL client with integrations for React, Angular, and more. It allows you to easily build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. To get the most value out of apollo-client, you should use it with one of its view layer integrations.

To get started with the React integration, go to  React Apollo documentation website.

 GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

 To get started with the GraphQL, go to official http://graphql.org/ documentation website.
